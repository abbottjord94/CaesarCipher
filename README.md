# CaesarCipher
A simple C++ implementation of a Caesar cipher

This was used as a challenge for the Humboldt State University Computer Science Club during the Fall 2019 semester. The goal of the challenge is to write a function to decrypt a message that's been encrypted with a Caesar cipher, with a key found in a binary search tree puzzle.
